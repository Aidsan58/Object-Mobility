Made in collaboration with two other programmers.


This program demonstrates object mobility. It works by sending Json objects from one server to another.

To run program:
1) run make clean
2) run make
3) Three executables will be made and must be run in the correct order:
    1.hw5GrandmaHome
    2.hw5Forest
    3.hw5Home
4)Upon creating hw5Home, one person object and two thing objects are created. They are automatically send to the forest server and then the grandma server.
5)Each server will show a record of what objects were received and which were sent.
